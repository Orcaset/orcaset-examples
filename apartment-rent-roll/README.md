This notebook demonstrates how [Orcaset](https://github.com/Orcaset) enables automated financial analysis. It builds a rental income model that adapts to any apartment rent roll configuration without requiring any changes. Changing the unit count, type, or in-place leases will automatically flow through to the projections.
